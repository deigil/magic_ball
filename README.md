Welcome to Smart Reader, a Raspberry Pi project designed to enhance learning and reading experiences for kids. This project utilizes a camera to capture images, converts the text in the image to speech, and outputs the result to both the console and speakers.

## Features

- **Image Capture:** The `capture.py` script captures images using the connected camera.
- **Text Recognition:** Utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from the captured images.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts the recognized text to speech and outputs it to both the console and speakers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deigil/smart_reader.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd smart_reader
    ```

3. Install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file (to be implemented):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Connect the camera to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Run the `main.py` script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Experience the Smart Reader in action as it captures images, converts text, and provides a rich learning and reading experience.
